"""Context-aware interrupt handler for intelligent interruption detection.

This module provides intelligent filtering of user interruptions based on:
1. Agent state (speaking vs silent)
2. User input classification (backchannel signals vs actual commands)
3. Configurable word lists for backchannels and commands

The handler prevents false positive interruptions from backchannel signals
(like "yeah", "okay", "hmm") when the agent is speaking, while still allowing
genuine interruptions and commands.
