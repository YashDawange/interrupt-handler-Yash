## Test Scenarios and Validation

### Scenario 1: Passive Acknowledgement ("Yeah")

**Goal:** Ensure that short, non-interruptive acknowledgements do not stop the agent while it is speaking.

**Context:**
The agent is actively speaking (TTS stream running).

```
15:33:36.559 INFO    livekit.agents    TTS       {"room": "playground", "ttfb": 0.27, "audio_duration": 11.47}
```

**User Input:**

```
"Yeah"
```

STT receives the transcript:

```
15:33:41.385 DEBUG   livekit.agents    received  {"room": "playground", "transcript": "Yeah.", "confidence": 0.56}
```

**Expected Behavior:**

* No interruption.
* No flush event.
* Agent continues TTS/LLM output smoothly.

**Observed Behavior:**
The agent continues speaking, generating the next part of the response:

```
15:33:43.652 INFO    livekit.agents    LLM       {"room": "playground", "metrics": "tokens_per_sec": 11.46}
15:33:44.450 INFO    livekit.agents    TTS       {"room": "playground", "ttfb": 0.42}
```

There is **no `flush`** or stream closure event.

**Conclusion:**
The ignore-word filtering works correctly. Passive acknowledgements are ignored while the agent is speaking.

### Scenario 2: Active Interruption ("Stop")

**Goal:** Ensure meaningful user commands interrupt the agent immediately.

**User Input:**

```
"Yes. Stop."
```

Logged transcript:

```
15:17:19.255 DEBUG   livekit.agents    received  {"room": "playground", "transcript": "Yes. Stop."}
```

**Expected Behavior:**

* Immediate interruption
* Ongoing TTS stream should be flushed and closed

**Observed Behavior:**
As soon as the non-ignored command is detected, the stream closes:

```
15:17:37.550 DEBUG   livekit.agents    stream    {"room": "playground", "source": "SOURCE_MICROPHONE", "status": "closed"}
```

**Conclusion:**
The interruption logic functions exactly as intended. Commands not in the ignore list trigger an immediate stop.
