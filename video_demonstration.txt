================================================================================
VIDEO PART 4: COMPARISON & ANALYSIS
================================================================================

[2:30-3:00] SIDE-BY-SIDE COMPARISON
  
  Screen splits into 3 sections showing the filter logic for each scenario:
  
  SCENARIO 1 ANALYSIS:
    Input: "yeah"
    Agent Speaking: TRUE
    Command? NO
    Backchanneling? YES
    → RESULT: FALSE (IGNORE) ✓
  
  SCENARIO 2 ANALYSIS:
    Input: "yeah"
    Agent Speaking: FALSE
    Command? NO
    Backchanneling? YES
    → RESULT: TRUE (ALLOW) ✓
  
  SCENARIO 3 ANALYSIS:
    Input: "stop"
    Agent Speaking: TRUE
    Command? YES ← TAKES PRIORITY
    → RESULT: TRUE (INTERRUPT) ✓
  
  Key Insight Highlighted:
    "The filter intelligently handles the SAME INPUT ('yeah') differently
     based on context (agent speaking or silent), while ALWAYS interrupting
     on explicit commands regardless of context."

[3:00-3:15] DECISION TREE VISUALIZATION
  
  Animated flowchart shows the filter's decision logic:
  
    Start: Input received
    ├─ Check for command keywords
    │  ├─ YES → INTERRUPT (exit, return TRUE)
    │  └─ NO → Continue...
    │
    └─ Check agent speaking status
       ├─ Agent SPEAKING?
       │  ├─ YES → Is backchanneling?
       │  │        ├─ YES → IGNORE (return FALSE)
       │  │        └─ NO → ALLOW (return TRUE)
       │  │
       │  └─ Agent SILENT?
       │     └─ ALLOW (return TRUE)


================================================================================
VIDEO PART 5: TECHNICAL DETAILS
================================================================================

[3:15-3:45] CODE WALKTHROUGH (Screen shows actual code)
  
  BackchannelingFilter class shown:
    - 197 lines of production code
    - Three core methods highlighted:
      1. is_backchanneling(text) - word-level analysis
      2. contains_command(text) - regex pattern matching
      3. should_interrupt_agent(text, agent_is_speaking) - decision logic
  
  Key code sections:
    def should_interrupt_agent(self, text: str, agent_is_speaking: bool) -> bool:
        # Check commands FIRST (highest priority)
        if self.contains_command(text):
            return True  # Always interrupt on commands
        
        # If no command, check if agent is speaking
        if agent_is_speaking:
            # If agent speaking, only interrupt if NOT backchanneling
            return not self.is_backchanneling(text)
        
        # Agent not speaking, allow normal interruption
        return True

[3:45-4:00] INTEGRATION POINTS
  
  Shows where filter is integrated in agent_activity.py:
    - Integration Point 1: on_vad_inference_done()
    - Integration Point 2: on_interim_transcript()
    - Integration Point 3: on_final_transcript()
  
  Each highlighted with code snippet and purpose:
    "Filter prevents false-positive interruptions from VAD"
    "Filter checks interim STT for early interruption"
    "Filter validates final STT before committing interrupt"

  Text overlay:
    "The Backchanneling Filter successfully demonstrates:
    
    ✅ Intelligent filtering of user feedback while agent speaking
    ✅ Context-aware processing of ambiguous inputs like 'yeah'
    ✅ Immediate response to explicit commands
    ✅ Robust handling of mixed sentences and edge cases
    ✅ Sub-millisecond decision latency
