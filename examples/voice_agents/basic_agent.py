"""
Basic Voice Agent with Intelligent Interruption Handling

This agent demonstrates:
1. Natural voice conversation with STT/TTS
2. Smart interruption filtering (ignores "yeah", "ok" while speaking)
3. Immediate response to command words ("wait", "stop", "no")
4. Proper session management and metrics
