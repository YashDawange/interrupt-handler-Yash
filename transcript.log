Agent : 
Hey! What can I do for you today? Want to know the weather, or maybe crack a joke?
You : 
Narate to me a story.
Agent : 
Sure thing! Here's a quick story for you:
Once upon a time, in a tiny village tucked between rolling hills, there lived a clever fox named Felix. Felix loved puzzles more than anything. One day, he found a mysterious locked box in the forest.
You : 
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
Stop.
Agent :
Stopping right there! Let me know if you want me to pick up where I left off or switch gears.
You :
Yeah.
Agent :
Alright, picking up the story! Felix was so curious about that locked box he decided to ask the wise old owl in the forest for help. The owl smiled and said, "Sometimes, the key to a puzzle is patience." What do
You :
Okay.
Go on.
I see.
Agent :
Glad you do! Want me to keep going or switch to something else?
You :
That's enough.
Agent :
Got it! Just say the word if you want another story or anything else.
